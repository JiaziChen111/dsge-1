### Notes on DSGE models 

These notes were compiled from classes delivered on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models. 

Tools commonly used for simulation and estimation of DSGE are:

* Matlab based [Dynare](http://www.dynare.org/) from the French think-tank [CEPREMAP](http://www.cepremap.fr/). 

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) became an interesting option after the NY FED published its [model](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl)

Other great references are:

* Prof [Johannes Pfeifer](https://sites.google.com/site/pfeiferecon/dynare) paper _A Guide to Specifying Observation Equations for the Estimation of DSGE Models_ is a great guide to Dynare inner workings.

* Prof [Celso Costa Jr](https://vernonpress.com/title?id=70) book _Understanding DSGE models_ is a great resource for both beginers and practicioners.
